Wiley Customer Service (06/01/2026, 08:49:49): Thank you for contacting Wiley Customer Service. My name is Hannah. How may I assist you today? 
Pablo (06/01/2026, 08:53:29): Hi Hannah, how are you? I am contacting the service to ask about article fees policies. My institutions has an agreement with Wiley so we can have open access to some journals. However, there is usually a limit on the number of papers per year that can be published in some of this journals. When our paper (Article ID: ECE372725) was accepted in Ecology and Evolution, the limit had already been reached. Nonetheless, we do not have fundings to pay for the fees. Is there anything we can do? 
Wiley Customer Service (06/01/2026, 08:53:54): Kindly allow me a moment while I look into this for you. 
Wiley Customer Service (06/01/2026, 08:57:52): Thank you for waiting. 
Wiley Customer Service (06/01/2026, 08:59:02): I am sorry to hear that your funder has reached its limits. Unfortunately at this time, we are only able to grant fee waivers and discounts to authors from countries found on our Open Access Waiver Country list: https://authorservices.wiley.com/author-resources/Journal-Authors/open-access/article-publication-charges/waivers-and-discounts.html 
Pablo (06/01/2026, 09:01:45): Is it possible to wait until the limit is reset in 2026? Or does ir depend on the day of acceptance? If so, how can I know that the editorial board did not wait until the cap was reached to accepting it? Because the limita had not been reached when we submitted it 
Wiley Customer Service (06/01/2026, 09:04:14): Postponing publication may also delay the visibility of your article in the research community. The article will not be discoverable or citable until it is formally published, which could impact how quickly your work gains recognition and begins accumulating citations. 
Wiley Customer Service (06/01/2026, 09:04:34): If you're unsure about the availability of funds, please reach out directly to your library as they can confirm whether funding is still available and advise on next steps. 
Pablo (06/01/2026, 09:06:06): We are aware of the dissadvantages of waiting, but I would like to know if that would be possible since the library has confirmed that there is no funding available. 
Pablo (06/01/2026, 09:07:02): And if that is possible, how can I proceed, since, to the best of my knowledge, the quota should reset with the beginning of the new year. 
Pablo (06/01/2026, 09:07:10): Thank you very much in advance for your help 
Wiley Customer Service (06/01/2026, 09:07:43): Apologies, I am unable to address your query directly. Please allow me to forward this to the relevant department for further assistance. Someone from our dedicated support team will contact you shortly via email. 
Wiley Customer Service (06/01/2026, 09:07:55): Aside from this, is there anything else I can help you with today? 
Pablo (06/01/2026, 09:08:30): Thank you very much, that was all the assistance required. Have a good day!
